## Project Summary: Short description of the scenario, objectives, and business case. 

## üì¶ Project Summary
**Scenario:**  
This project simulates a real-world package delivery operation in Nairobi, Kenya, where a logistics company must optimize delivery routes, improve driver performance, and reduce its environmental footprint. The company uses GPS telemetry, weather data, and vehicle tracking to monitor and analyze delivery operations in real time.

**Objectives:**  
- Design a robust data model (star schema) for route-based delivery analytics

- Track and evaluate driver performance using key delivery metrics

- Analyze the impact of weather on delivery efficiency and fuel usage

- Estimate and report on the carbon emissions of the delivery fleet

- Provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards and KPIs

**Business Case:**   
In urban delivery logistics, inefficiencies in routing, delays due to weather, and poor fuel optimization lead to increased costs and environmental impact. This project aims to provide a data-driven route intelligence solution that enables:

- üìà Improved operational decision-making through real-time performance monitoring

- ‚è± Better delivery time predictions using weather and distance analytics

- ‚ôªÔ∏è Sustainable logistics with estimated carbon emission reporting

- üß† Insightful dashboards for stakeholders to identify optimization opportunities

By integrating dynamic data sources and analytics into a unified reporting system, this solution empowers logistics managers to make smarter, faster, and greener decisions.


## Key Deliverables 
- Business KPIs:
- Top 3 insights

#### **1.1) Defining KPIs and success metrics:**
- **Average Delivery Time:**  Mean duration between StartTime and EndTime  
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:**  % of deliveries completed within expected time (if SLA is known)  
- **Carbon Emission per Delivery:**	 Based on vehicle emission factor √ó distance  
- **Driver Efficiency Score:**  Could combine # of deliveries, timeliness, and route complexity  
- **Fuel Consumption:**  Estimated from distance and vehicle fuel efficiency
#### **1.2) Designing star schema data model:**
